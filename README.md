There is a [blog article about the development of this app](http://www.micuintus.de/2017/10/01/cross-platform-mobile-app-development-for-ios-sailfishos-and-android-with-qtqml/).
Furthermore, the source code of a former version of this app for Android (2.x series) can be found [here](https://github.com/Berlin-Vegan/berlin-vegan-guide).

With the Berlin-Vegan guide, you have got quick access to an overview of the vegan
food and shopping possibilities in Berlin, Germany --- even while you are out and about.

The app contains over 300 entries of restaurants, snack bars and takeaways with
vegan declared offers from the www.berlin-vegan.de website.

The guide is not just suitable for vegetarians and vegans but also for all people who are
trying to live their life in a greener and more animal friendly way.
